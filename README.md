# DSpaceNet

DSpaceNet is a prototype of an online multi-agent online platform where users (agents) interact like in a social network, with the distinct that users can not only post messages in their spaces but also mobile programs that can migrate across spaces. Thus users can, for example, write and post their own watchdog processes that react to certain messages.
